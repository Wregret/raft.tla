## Original README

Formal TLA+ specification for the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raftconsensus.github.io). This is slightly updated compared to the dissertation version.

For more information, see Chapter 8 (Correctness) and Appendix B (Safety proof and formal specification) in https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation .

If you're trying to run the TLA+ model checker on this specification, check out Jin Li's changes in [Pull Request #4](https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla/pull/4/).
